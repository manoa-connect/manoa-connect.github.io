## Overview
To facilitate student connection, we introduce **Manoa Connect**, a social networking website that applies matching functionalities reminiscent of dating apps (_Tinder_, _Hinge_, etc.) but in the context of finding friends on the UH Manoa campus.

The motivation for this website are derived from the following:

* Despite 20,000 students on the UH Manoa campus, some students have a hard time making friends outside of their (ongoing/previous) classes or majors for various reasons
  * Difficulties being in a foreign environment (_i.e. incoming freshmen, sophomores, exchange students_)
  * Difficulty breaking into established social groups (_i.e. juniors/seniors_)
  * Lack of time to committing to social events
  * General social inexperience/introverted nature
* Developing friendships with people from different majors at UH Manoa provide new perspectives
* New career/networking opportunities can arise from students in different fields of study
* Learning how to socialize with people who have unique backgrounds nurtures social skills applicable throughout life

## Pages

This section provides a set of pages for Manoa Connect that will be implemented.

* Landing page
* User home page
* User profile page
* “Matching” page
* Friends page
* Chat page
* Settings page

Here are tentative descriptions of certain pages:

**User Profile:** Add/edit name, photo(s), major, likes/interests, list of (previous/current) classes, dorm/commuter/other status, clubs, MBTI

**Matching:** Random person pops up and users have the option of “match” or “skip” with two buttons

**Friends:** Add freinds to a favorites/block list that can also be accessed; this page also includes the feature to delete friends

**Chat:** List of chats with people matched and a selected chat page that allows for message functioning

**Settings:** Settings to filter people shown (i.e. by major, interests, etc.)
